# Translation
•	Built an English-to-French translation model using RNN, Bidirectional RNN, and Embedding-based architectures, achieving       98% validation accuracy with the embedding model.
•	Pre-processed and tokenized 180K+ sentences, optimized model performance with dropout and time-distributed layers, and saved                               serialized models for deployment.
•	Trained and evaluated deep learning models using Keras and TensorFlow, achieving 95%+ accuracy on translation tasks with limited vocabulary datasets.
